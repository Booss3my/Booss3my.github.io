Welcome to my page! My name is Oussama, and I'm an engineer from ENSEIRB-MATMECA with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, signal processing, and image processing.

My interests are diverse, but I'm particularly fascinated by Computer Vision and (unrelated) fraud detection. I strongly believe that computer vision still has progress to make and untapped potential.

In my free time, I love watching football, lifting weights, and sometimes watching a good old Japanese anime.
